h1. solrizer-fedora

An extension to projecthydra/solrizer that provides utilities for loading objects from Fedora Repositories and creating solr documents from them.

h2. Usage

<pre>gem install solrizer-fedora</pre>

You must tell the app where to find fedora and solr.  Put that information into config/fedora.yml and config/solr.yml

Then...

<pre>
irb
require "rubygems"
require "solrizer-fedora"
solrizer = Solrizer::Fedora::Solrizer.new
solrizer.solrize("demo:5")
</pre>


h2.  Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
